/// A protocol that defines the interface for cryptographic signing operations.
///
/// Types conforming to `Signer` are responsible for creating cryptographic signatures
/// using various algorithms (e.g., HMAC-SHA256, RSA, ECDSA) based on a signing context
/// and a secret key. This protocol is designed to be thread-safe and supports
/// asynchronous operations for potentially time-consuming cryptographic computations.
///
/// ## Responsibilities
/// - Create cryptographic signatures from signing contexts
/// - Handle different signature algorithms and key types
/// - Provide thread-safe signing operations
/// - Support asynchronous execution for performance
///
/// ## Conformance Requirements
/// Conforming types must implement the `sign(_:key:)` method and ensure thread safety
/// through the `Sendable` protocol. The signing context should contain all necessary
/// data required to create a deterministic signature.
public protocol Signer: Sendable {
    /// Creates a cryptographic signature for the given context using the specified key.
    ///
    /// This method performs the actual cryptographic signing operation. The implementation
    /// should extract the necessary data from the signing context and apply the appropriate
    /// cryptographic algorithm using the provided key.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///     - `context`: A `Context` object containing the data to be signed. The context
    ///        should provide a canonical representation of the data in a format suitable
    ///        for the specific signing algorithm.
    ///     - `secretKey`: The secret key used for cryptographic signing. This key should be kept
    ///        secure and not exposed in client-side code or logs. The key is used as the
    ///        HMAC key for creating the cryptographic signature.
    ///
    /// - Returns: A `String` representing the cryptographic signature, typically in hexadecimal
    ///            format or base64 encoding depending on the implementation.

/// A concrete implementation of the `Signer` protocol that uses HMAC-SHA256 for cryptographic signing.
///
/// `HMACSHA256Signer` provides a secure implementation of cryptographic signing using the
/// HMAC-SHA256 algorithm. It takes a `Context` object containing system and device information,
/// encodes it as JSON, and creates a cryptographic signature using a secret key.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// This signer is designed for authentication purposes where you need to verify the integrity
/// and authenticity of context data. It uses the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm, which provides:
/// - **Message Authentication**: Ensures the data hasn't been tampered with
/// - **Cryptographic Security**: Uses SHA-256 hash function with a secret key
/// - **Deterministic Output**: Same input always produces the same signature
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let signer = HMACSHA256Signer()
/// let context = Context() // System context
/// let signature = try await signer.sign(context)
/// ```
///
/// ## Implementation Details
///
/// The signing process involves:
/// 1. **JSON Encoding**: Converts the `Context` object to JSON data
/// 2. **String Conversion**: Converts JSON data to UTF-8 string
/// 3. **HMAC-SHA256**: Applies HMAC-SHA256 algorithm using the secret key
/// 4. **Hex Encoding**: Returns the signature as a hexadecimal string
///
/// ## Security Considerations
///
/// - **Secret Key**: The secret key is injected via dependency injection and should be kept secure
/// - **Context Data**: All context data is included in the signature, ensuring comprehensive verification
/// - **Algorithm**: HMAC-SHA256 is a well-established, cryptographically secure algorithm
///
/// ## Error Handling
///
/// The signer can throw errors in the following scenarios:
/// - **Encoding Failures**: If the context cannot be encoded as JSON
/// - **String Conversion**: If the JSON data cannot be converted to UTF-8 string
/// - **Cryptographic Errors**: If the HMAC operation fails

/// The main protocol for TruVideo SDK functionality.
///
/// This protocol defines the core interface for TruVideo SDK operations including
/// configuration, authentication, and status checking. Implementations of this
/// protocol provide the main entry point for SDK functionality.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // Configure the SDK
/// try TruvideoSdk.configure(with: options)
///
/// // Check authentication status
/// if TruvideoSdk.isAuthenticated {
///     // User is authenticated
/// }
///
/// // Authenticate the user
/// try await TruvideoSdk.authenticate()
/// ```
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// 1. **Configuration**: Call `configure(with:)` to set up the SDK
/// 2. **Authentication**: Call `authenticate()` to authenticate the user
/// 3. **Status Check**: Use `isAuthenticated` to check authentication status
///
/// ## Error Handling
///
/// ```swift
/// do {
///     try TruvideoSdk.configure(with: options)
///     try await TruvideoSdk.authenticate()
/// } catch TruVideoSdkError.configurationRequired {
///     // Handle configuration error
/// } catch TruVideoSdkError.authenticationFailed {
///     // Handle authentication error
/// } catch {
///     // Handle other errors
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// All methods in this protocol are thread-safe and can be called from any thread.
/// The SDK handles concurrent access internally.
///
/// ## Implementation Notes
///
/// - **Configuration**: Must be called before any other operations
/// - **Authentication**: Required after configuration to enable SDK features
/// - **Status Check**: Safe to call at any time
///
/// - Note: This protocol is the primary interface for TruVideo SDK operations.
/// - Important: Always configure the SDK before attempting authentication.
/// - Warning: Authentication is required to use most SDK features.

/// A protocol defining the interface for client authentication with the TruVideo API.
///
/// `AuthenticatableClient` provides a standardized way to authenticate devices and users
/// with the TruVideo API. It handles the authentication process by sending device context
/// information along with cryptographic signatures to verify the client's identity.
///
/// ## Authentication Flow
///
/// 1. **Device Context**: Collect device and system information
/// 2. **Signature Generation**: Create cryptographic signature using secret key
/// 3. **API Request**: Send authentication request with context and signature
/// 4. **Token Storage**: Store received authentication token for future use
/// 5. **API Access**: Use token for subsequent API requests
///
/// ## Security Considerations
///
/// ### API Key Security
///
/// - **Never expose in client code**: API keys should be server-side only
/// - **Use environment variables**: Store keys securely
/// - **Rotate regularly**: Change keys periodically
/// - **Scope appropriately**: Use least-privilege principle
///
/// ### Signature Security
///
/// - **Keep secret keys secure**: Never expose secret keys
/// - **Use strong algorithms**: HMAC-SHA256 or better
/// - **Include all context data**: Sign complete context
/// - **Validate server-side**: Verify signatures on server
///
/// ### Device Context
///
/// - **Accurate information**: Ensure device info is correct
/// - **Timestamp validation**: Check for clock skew
/// - **Context integrity**: Prevent tampering with context data
///
/// - Note: Authentication tokens are automatically stored after successful authentication.

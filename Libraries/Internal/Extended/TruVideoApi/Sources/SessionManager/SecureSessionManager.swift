/// A secure, environment-aware implementation of the `SessionManager` protocol.
///
/// `SecureSessionManager` provides encrypted storage and retrieval of authentication sessions
/// using AES-GCM encryption. It leverages the dependency injection system for environment
/// configuration and isolates session data per environment to prevent cross-environment
/// session leakage.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// This implementation combines multiple security layers:
/// - **AES-GCM Encryption**: All sessions are encrypted before storage using AES-GCM
///   (Galois/Counter Mode), which provides both confidentiality and authentication
/// - **Environment Isolation**: Sessions are stored in separate UserDefaults suites
///   based on the environment's base URL, preventing session mixing across environments
/// - **Type Safety**: Strongly-typed storage keys ensure compile-time safety
///
/// ## Architecture
///
/// The session manager uses a lazy-initialized storage backend that adapts to the
/// current environment. This allows the same manager instance to work across different
/// API environments (dev, staging, production) while maintaining proper data isolation.
///
/// ## Security Considerations
///
/// While sessions are encrypted using AES-GCM, they are stored in UserDefaults rather
/// than the Keychain. This provides a balance between security and accessibility for
/// session data that needs to be accessed frequently. For highly sensitive credentials,
/// consider using KeychainStorage directly.
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let sessionManager = SecureSessionManager()
///
/// // Store a new authentication session
/// let token = AuthToken(accessToken: "abc123", refreshToken: "xyz789")
/// let session = AuthSession(apiKey: "my-api-key", authToken: token)
/// try sessionManager.set(session)
///
/// // Retrieve the current session
/// if let currentSession = sessionManager.currentSession {
///     print("Logged in with API key: \(currentSession.apiKey)")
///     // Use session.authToken for authenticated requests
/// }
///
/// // Clear the session (logout)
/// try sessionManager.deleteCurrentSession()
/// ```
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// This class is marked as `@unchecked Sendable` because it uses lazy initialization
/// for its storage property. Ensure that the storage is fully initialized before
/// concurrent access occurs. The underlying `UserDefaultsStorage` and `AESCrypto`
/// are designed to be thread-safe.
///
/// - Note: Session retrieval through `currentSession` never throws. If decryption
///   or storage access fails, it returns `nil` rather than propagating errors.

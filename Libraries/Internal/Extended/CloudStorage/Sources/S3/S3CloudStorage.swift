/// Global actor that provides thread-safe isolation for S3 cloud storage operations.
///
/// The S3CloudStorageActor provides a centralized execution context for managing
/// AWS S3 cloud storage operations, ensuring that all storage operations, file
/// uploads, downloads, and metadata management occur on a single, well-defined
/// executor.
@globalActor
actor S3CloudStorageActor {
    /// The shared global actor instance used to isolate device operations.
    static let shared = S3CloudStorageActor()
}

/// A concrete implementation of `CloudStorage` that uploads files to Amazon S3.
///
/// This struct provides a high-level interface for uploading data to Amazon S3 buckets
/// using the AWS SDK for iOS. It abstracts the complexity of S3 operations and provides
/// a simple, consistent API for file uploads with progress tracking and control capabilities.
///
/// ## Features
///
/// - **Asynchronous Uploads**: All upload operations are performed asynchronously
/// - **Progress Tracking**: Monitor upload progress through the returned `UploadTask`
/// - **Upload Control**: Pause, resume, and cancel uploads as needed
/// - **Content Type Support**: Automatic handling of MIME types and file extensions
/// - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for network and S3-specific issues
/// - **Thread Safety**: Safe for concurrent use across multiple threads
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let cloudStorage = S3CloudStorage()
///
/// // Upload an image
/// let imageData = UIImage(named: "profile")?.jpegData(compressionQuality: 0.8) ?? Data()
/// let uploadTask = cloudStorage.upload(
///     imageData,
///     fileName: "users/123/profile-photo.jpg",
///     contentType: .jpeg
/// )
///
/// // Monitor progress
/// uploadTask.uploadProgress { progress in
///     let percentage = progress.fractionCompleted * 100
///     print("Upload progress: \(percentage)%")
/// }
///
/// // Control upload
/// uploadTask.pause()   // Pause upload
/// uploadTask.resume()  // Resume upload
/// uploadTask.cancel()  // Cancel upload
/// ```

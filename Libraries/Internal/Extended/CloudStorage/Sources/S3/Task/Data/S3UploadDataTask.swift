/// A global actor that provides thread-safe isolation for S3 upload data operations.
///
/// `S3UploadDataTaskActor` serves as a concurrency boundary for all S3 upload data
/// related operations, ensuring thread-safe access to shared state and preventing
/// data races during concurrent upload operations. It provides a centralized point
/// of coordination for multiple upload data tasks that may be running simultaneously.
@globalActor
actor S3UploadDataTaskActor {
    /// The shared global actor instance used to isolate S3 upload data operations.
    static let shared = S3UploadDataTaskActor()
}

/// A concrete implementation of an upload task for uploading data to Amazon S3.
///
/// `S3UploadDataTask` manages the complete lifecycle of a data upload operation to an S3 bucket,
/// providing comprehensive control over the upload process including starting, pausing, resuming,
/// and cancelling operations. This class extends the base `S3UploadTask` functionality by
/// implementing the `UploadDataTask` protocol, which adds support for monitoring upload progress
/// and handling completion callbacks.
///
/// ## Key Features
///
/// - **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking with detailed byte-level information
/// - **Lifecycle Control**: Full control over upload operations (pause, resume, cancel)
/// - **Completion Handling**: Robust error handling and success/failure callbacks
/// - **Thread Safety**: Actor-based concurrency model for safe multi-threaded operations
/// - **AWS Integration**: Direct integration with AWS S3 Transfer Utility
///
/// ## Upload Lifecycle
///
/// The upload process follows these stages:
/// 1. **Initialization**: Task is created with data payload and configuration
/// 2. **Execution**: Upload begins and progresses through the network
/// 3. **Monitoring**: Progress callbacks provide real-time updates
/// 4. **Completion**: Final result (success or failure) is delivered via completion handlers
///
/// ## State Management
///
/// The task maintains its state throughout the upload lifecycle:
/// - `.initialized`: Task created but not yet started
/// - `.resumed`: Upload is actively in progress
/// - `.suspended`: Upload is paused and can be resumed
/// - `.cancelled`: Upload was cancelled and cannot be resumed
/// - `.finishing`: Upload completed, processing final callbacks
/// - `.finished`: Upload fully completed and cleaned up
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// This class uses Swift's actor model with `S3UploadDataTaskActor` to ensure thread-safe
/// access to internal state. All state modifications and AWS SDK interactions are properly
/// isolated to prevent data races during concurrent operations.
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create upload task
/// let payload = S3DataPayload(
///     bucket: "my-bucket",
///     contentType: .videoMp4,
///     data: videoData,
///     path: "uploads/video.mp4"
/// )
/// let uploadTask = S3UploadDataTask(
///     payload: payload,
///     delegate: self,
///     monitor: monitor
/// )
///
/// // Monitor progress
/// uploadTask.onProgress { progress in
///     let percentage = progress.fractionCompleted * 100
///     print("Upload progress: \(percentage)%")
/// }
///
/// // Handle completion
/// uploadTask.onComplete { result in
///     switch result {
///     case .success(let url):
///         print("Upload completed: \(url)")
///     case .failure(let error):
///         print("Upload failed: \(error)")
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Control upload
/// uploadTask.pause()   // Pause upload
/// uploadTask.resume()  // Resume upload
/// uploadTask.cancel()  // Cancel upload
/// ```

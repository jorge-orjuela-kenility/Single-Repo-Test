/// A global actor that provides thread-safe isolation for S3 upload operations.
///
/// `S3UploadTaskActor` serves as a concurrency boundary for all S3 upload
/// related operations, ensuring thread-safe access to shared state and preventing
/// data races during concurrent upload operations. It provides a centralized point
/// of coordination for multiple upload tasks that may be running simultaneously.

actor S3UploadTaskActor {
    /// The shared global actor instance used to isolate S3 upload operations.
    static let shared = S3UploadTaskActor()
}

/// A protocol that defines the contract for handling S3 upload task completion events.
///
/// `S3UploadTaskDelegate` provides a mechanism for objects to be notified when an S3 upload
/// task completes, enabling cleanup operations, retry logic, and other post-completion
/// processing. This delegate pattern allows for loose coupling between upload tasks and
/// their management systems.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// The delegate pattern is used to notify interested parties when an upload task reaches
/// its final state (either completed successfully or failed). This enables:
/// - Resource cleanup and management
/// - Retry logic implementation
/// - Task lifecycle tracking
/// - Integration with higher-level upload management systems
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// This protocol conforms to `Sendable` to ensure that delegate methods can be safely
/// called from any thread context, including actor-isolated contexts.
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```swift
/// class UploadManager: S3UploadTaskDelegate {
///     private var activeTasks: Set<S3UploadTask> = []
///
///     func startUpload(payload: S3DataPayload) {
///         let task = S3UploadDataTask(
///             payload: payload,
///             delegate: self,
///             monitor: nil
///         )
///         activeTasks.insert(task)
///     }
///
///     func taskDidComplete(_ task: S3UploadTask) {
///         // Clean up completed task
///         activeTasks.remove(task)
///
///         // Handle completion logic
///         if let error = task.error {
///             handleUploadFailure(task, error: error)
///         } else {
///             handleUploadSuccess(task)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
protocol S3UploadTaskDelegate: AnyObject, Sendable {
    /// Notifies the delegate that an upload task has completed.
    ///
    /// This method is called when an upload task reaches its final state, regardless of
    /// whether it completed successfully or failed. The delegate can use this opportunity
    /// to perform cleanup operations, update internal state, or trigger retry logic.
    ///
    /// - Parameter task: The `S3UploadTask` that has completed. Check the task's `error`
    ///                   property to determine if the upload succeeded or failed.
    func taskDidComplete(_ task: S3UploadTask)
}

/// A base class for managing S3 upload operations with comprehensive state management and monitoring.
///
/// `S3UploadTask` serves as the foundation for all S3 upload operations, providing core functionality
/// for state management, lifecycle control, and monitoring capabilities. This class implements the
/// `Identifiable` protocol and provides a robust framework for tracking upload progress, handling
/// errors, and managing completion callbacks.
///
/// ## Key Features
///
/// - **State Management**: Comprehensive state tracking with thread-safe transitions
/// - **Lifecycle Control**: Built-in support for pause, resume, and cancel operations
/// - **Error Handling**: Robust error management with detailed error information
/// - **Monitoring**: Optional monitoring support for observing upload events
/// - **Completion Handling**: Flexible completion callback system
/// - **Thread Safety**: Actor-based concurrency model for safe multi-threaded operations
///
/// ## Upload Lifecycle
///
/// The upload process follows these stages:
/// 1. **Initialization**: Task is created with unique identifier and configuration
/// 2. **Execution**: Upload begins and progresses through various states
/// 3. **State Transitions**: Task moves through states based on operations and external factors
/// 4. **Completion**: Final result (success or failure) is processed and callbacks are invoked
/// 5. **Cleanup**: Resources are cleaned up and final state is set
///
/// ## State Management
///
/// The task maintains its state throughout the upload lifecycle:
/// - `.initialized`: Task created but not yet started
/// - `.resumed`: Upload is actively in progress
/// - `.suspended`: Upload is paused and can be resumed
/// - `.finishing`: Upload completed, processing final callbacks
/// - `.finished`: Upload fully completed and cleaned up
/// - `.cancelled`: Upload was cancelled and cannot be resumed
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// This class uses Swift's actor model with `S3UploadTaskActor` to ensure thread-safe
/// access to internal state. All state modifications and completion processing are properly
/// isolated to prevent data races during concurrent operations.
///
/// ## Usage Context
///
/// This class is typically used as a base class for specific upload implementations such as:
/// - `S3UploadDataTask` for uploading binary data
/// - `S3StreamUploadTask` for streaming uploads
/// - Custom upload task implementations
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create upload task (typically done by concrete implementations)
/// let uploadTask = S3UploadDataTask(
///     payload: payload,
///     delegate: self,
///     monitor: monitor
/// )
///
/// // Monitor state changes
/// if uploadTask.state == .resumed {
///     print("Upload in progress...")
/// }
///
/// // Check for errors
/// if let error = uploadTask.error {
///     print("Upload failed: \(error)")
/// }
///
/// // Access response when available
/// if let response = uploadTask.response {
///     print("Upload completed with status: \(response.statusCode)")
/// }
/// ```

/// A protocol that defines the contract for monitoring S3 upload task lifecycle events.
///
/// `S3TaskMonitor` provides a comprehensive monitoring system for observing and reacting
/// to key events throughout the lifecycle of S3 upload operations. Implementations can
/// use this protocol to build logging systems, analytics tracking, error monitoring,
/// performance measurement, and debugging tools for S3 upload functionality.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// This protocol enables comprehensive observability of S3 upload operations by providing
/// hooks for all significant events in the upload lifecycle. It supports monitoring of
/// different types of upload tasks including standard data uploads, streaming uploads,
/// and their individual components.
///
/// ## Key Features
///
/// - **Lifecycle Monitoring**: Complete coverage of upload task lifecycle events
/// - **Multi-Task Support**: Monitors different types of upload tasks (data, stream, parts)
/// - **Error Tracking**: Detailed error information for debugging and analytics
/// - **Performance Metrics**: Event timing and completion tracking
/// - **Thread Safety**: Sendable protocol for safe concurrent usage
/// - **Queue Management**: Configurable dispatch queue for callback execution
///
/// ## Monitoring Categories
///
/// The protocol provides monitoring capabilities for three main categories:
/// 1. **UploadTask Events**: General upload task lifecycle (cancel, finish, resume, suspend)
/// 2. **UploadDataTask Events**: Specific data upload events (creation failure, completion)
/// 3. **StreamUploadTask Events**: Streaming upload part events (cancel, complete, resume, suspend)
///
/// ## Implementation Guidelines
///
/// Conforming types should:
/// - Handle all protocol methods to ensure complete event coverage
/// - Use the provided `queue` property for thread-safe callback execution
/// - Implement efficient event processing to avoid performance impact
/// - Consider batching or filtering events for high-volume scenarios
/// - Provide meaningful logging and analytics data
///
/// ## Usage Context
///
/// This protocol is typically implemented by:
/// - Logging and analytics systems
/// - Performance monitoring tools
/// - Debugging and diagnostic utilities
/// - Error tracking and reporting systems
/// - Custom upload management solutions
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// class MyS3Monitor: S3TaskMonitor {
///     private let logger: Logger
///     private let analytics: AnalyticsService
///
///     init(logger: Logger, analytics: AnalyticsService) {
///         self.logger = logger
///         self.analytics = analytics
///     }
///
///     func taskDidFinish(_ task: S3UploadTask) {
///         logger.info("Upload task completed: \(task.id)")
///         analytics.track("upload_completed", properties: [
///             "task_id": task.id,
///             "duration": task.duration
///         ])
///     }
///
///     func uploadDataTask(_ task: S3UploadDataTask, didFinishWithURL url: URL?, error: UtilityError?) {
///         if let error = error {
///             logger.error("Upload failed: \(error)")
///             analytics.track("upload_failed", properties: ["error": error.localizedDescription])
///         } else if let url = url {
///             logger.info("Upload succeeded: \(url)")
///             analytics.track("upload_succeeded", properties: ["url": url.absoluteString])
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
public protocol S3TaskMonitor: Sendable {
    /// The dispatch queue on which monitor callback methods are executed.
    ///
    /// This property specifies the dispatch queue that will be used for executing
    /// all monitor callback methods. The queue ensures thread-safe execution of
    /// monitoring operations and allows implementations to control the execution
    /// context for their monitoring logic.
    ///
    /// ## Default Implementation
    ///
    /// The default implementation returns the main queue (`.main`), ensuring that
    /// monitoring callbacks are executed on the main thread. This is suitable for
    /// most monitoring implementations that need to update UI or perform operations
    /// that should occur on the main thread.
    ///
    /// ## Custom Implementation
    ///
    /// Implementations can override this property to use custom queues for specific
    /// monitoring needs, such as:
    /// - Background queues for heavy processing
    /// - Serial queues for ordered event processing
    /// - Concurrent queues for parallel event handling
    ///
    /// ## Thread Safety
    ///
    /// All monitor callback methods will be executed on the queue specified by this
    /// property, ensuring consistent and thread-safe execution of monitoring operations.

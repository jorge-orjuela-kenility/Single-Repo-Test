/// A protocol that defines the contract for cloud storage operations.
///
/// `CloudStorage` provides a standardized interface for uploading data to cloud storage
/// services such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage. This protocol
/// abstracts the underlying storage implementation details and provides a consistent API
/// for file upload operations across different cloud providers.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// Cloud storage operations are essential for applications that need to store and
/// retrieve files from remote storage services. This protocol provides a unified
/// interface for upload operations, allowing applications to work with different
/// cloud storage providers without needing to know the specific implementation details.
///
/// ## Features
///
/// - **Unified API**: Consistent interface across different cloud storage providers
/// - **Async Operations**: Non-blocking upload operations with progress tracking
/// - **Content Type Support**: Proper MIME type handling for different file types
/// - **Upload Task Management**: Full control over upload lifecycle (pause, resume, cancel)
/// - **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking during uploads
///
/// ## Supported Content Types
///
/// The protocol supports various content types through the `ContentType` enum:
/// - **Images**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
/// - **Videos**: MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM
/// - **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT
/// - **Audio**: MP3, WAV, AAC, FLAC
/// - **Archives**: ZIP, RAR, 7Z
/// - **Custom**: Any MIME type for specialized use cases
///
/// ## Upload Task Management
///
/// Uploads return an `UploadTask` that provides full control over the upload process:
/// - **Progress Monitoring**: Track upload progress in real-time
/// - **State Management**: Monitor upload state (uploading, paused, completed, etc.)
/// - **Control Operations**: Pause, resume, or cancel uploads
/// - **Error Handling**: Handle upload failures gracefully
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // Upload an image
/// let imageData = UIImage(named: "photo")?.jpegData(compressionQuality: 0.8)
/// let uploadTask = cloudStorage.upload(
///     imageData!,
///     fileName: "profile-photo.jpg",
///     contentType: .image(.jpeg)
/// )
///
/// // Monitor upload progress
/// uploadTask.uploadProgress { progress in
///     print("Upload progress: \(Int(progress.fractionCompleted * 100))%")
/// }
///
/// // Control upload lifecycle
/// uploadTask.pause()  // Pause upload
/// uploadTask.resume() // Resume upload
/// uploadTask.cancel() // Cancel upload
///
/// // Upload a video with custom content type
/// let videoData = try Data(contentsOf: videoURL)
/// let videoUploadTask = cloudStorage.upload(
///     videoData,
///     fileName: "presentation.mp4",
///     contentType: .video(.mp4)
/// )
///
/// // Upload a document
/// let documentData = "Hello, World!".data(using: .utf8)!
/// let documentUploadTask = cloudStorage.upload(
///     documentData,
///     fileName: "readme.txt",
///     contentType: .text(.plain)
/// )
/// ```
///
public protocol CloudStorage: Sendable {
    /// Uploads data to cloud storage and returns an upload task for monitoring and control.
    ///
    /// This method initiates an upload operation to the cloud storage service and returns
    /// an `UploadDataTask` that provides full control over the upload process. The upload
    /// task allows you to monitor progress, control the upload lifecycle, and handle
    /// completion or errors.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - data: The data to upload to cloud storage
    ///   - fileName: The name under which the file will be stored in cloud storage
    ///   - contentType: The MIME type of the data being uploaded
    /// - Returns: An `UploadDataTask` that provides control and monitoring capabilities for the upload operation
    func upload(_ data: Data, fileName: String, contentType: ContentType) -> any UploadDataTask

/// A protocol that defines the contract for network requests that expect response data.
///
/// `DataRequest` extends the base `Request` protocol to provide specialized functionality
/// for handling network requests that expect a response body. It provides comprehensive
/// serialization capabilities, validation methods, and response processing for various
/// data formats including JSON, raw data, and strings.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// This protocol enables standardized handling of HTTP requests that return data,
/// providing a consistent interface for serialization, validation, and response processing.
/// It supports multiple output formats and flexible validation strategies, making it
/// suitable for a wide range of network communication scenarios.
///
/// ## Key Features
///
/// - **Multiple Serialization Formats**: Support for JSON decoding, raw data, and string responses
/// - **Flexible Validation**: Custom and status code-based response validation
/// - **Async/Await Support**: Modern asynchronous programming with Swift concurrency
/// - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with `NetworkingError`
/// - **Response Processing**: Advanced response handling with empty response code support
/// - **Method Chaining**: Fluent API for request configuration and validation
///
/// ## Serialization Support
///
/// The protocol supports three main serialization types:
/// 1. **Decodable Types**: JSON decoding into Swift models
/// 2. **Raw Data**: Direct access to response bytes
/// 3. **String**: Text-based responses with configurable encoding
///
/// ## Validation Capabilities
///
/// - **Status Code Validation**: Automatic validation against acceptable HTTP status codes
/// - **Custom Validation**: User-defined validation logic for complex response requirements
/// - **Default Validation**: Standard validation for common HTTP scenarios
///
/// ## Usage Context
///
/// This protocol is typically implemented by:
/// - HTTP client libraries
/// - API service layers
/// - Network abstraction layers
/// - REST client implementations
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // JSON serialization
/// let userRequest: DataRequest = session.request("https://api.example.com/users/123")
/// let userResponse = await userRequest.serializing(User.self)
/// let user = try await userResponse.value
///
/// // Raw data serialization
/// let dataResponse = await userRequest.serializingData()
/// let imageData = try await dataResponse.value
///
/// // String serialization
/// let textResponse = await userRequest.serializingString()
/// let text = try await textResponse.value
///
/// // Validation
/// let validatedRequest = userRequest
///     .validate(acceptableStatusCodes: [200, 201])
///     .validate { request, response, data in
///         guard response.statusCode == 200 else {
///             throw NetworkingError(kind: .responseValidationFailed, failureReason: "Unexpected status")
///         }
///     }
/// ```

    /// A typealias defining the signature for custom response validation closures.
    ///
    /// This closure type provides a standardized way to implement custom validation logic
    /// for network responses. It allows validation of the request, response metadata,
    /// and response data to ensure they meet specific requirements before the response
    /// is considered successful.

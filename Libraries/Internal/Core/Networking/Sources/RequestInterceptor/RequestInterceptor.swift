/// - Retrying failed requests based on specific conditions (e.g., network errors, token refresh).
/// - Monitoring and logging request outcomes.
///
/// Conforming types must implement the required methods from both `RequestInterceptor` and `RequestRetrier`, enabling
/// full control over request
/// modification and retry logic.

/// ## Example
/// ```swift
/// struct MediaLibrary: Library {
///     let name = "TruVideoMedia"
///     let version = "1.0.0"
///
///     func configure(with configuration: SDKConfiguration) {
///         // Configure media-specific dependencies and services

///     }

///
/// `LibraryRegistry` provides a static interface for registering third-party or internal modules
/// that are part of the SDK or host application. This information can be used for diagnostics,
/// telemetry, analytics, or debugging purposes to understand what components are included
/// in a given runtime.
///
/// The registry manages library registration and configuration, allowing for dynamic
/// discovery and setup of modules during SDK initialization.
///
/// - Note: The class is marked as `@unchecked Sendable` since it maintains static mutable state.
///   Care should be taken to access or mutate state in a thread-safe manner if extended.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```swift
/// // Register a library
/// LibraryRegistry.register(MediaLibrary())
///
/// // Configure all registered libraries
/// LibraryRegistry.configureAll()
/// ```

    /// registered with the registry. It iterates through each registered library
    /// and calls its `configure(with:)` method, allowing each library to set up
    /// its dependencies, services, and environment-specific configurations.

    /// This method is not thread-safe. It should be called from a single thread
    /// during SDK initialization, typically from the main thread.

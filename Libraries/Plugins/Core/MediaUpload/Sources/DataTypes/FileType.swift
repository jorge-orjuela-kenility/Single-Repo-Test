/// An enumeration that defines the high-level categories of supported media.
///
/// `MediaType` represents the semantic classification of a media resource
/// (e.g., video, image, audio, or document). Unlike `FileType`, which specifies
/// the exact file extension (e.g., `.mp4`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`), `MediaType` groups
/// those extensions into broader categories that are meaningful to the TruVideo
/// API and client applications.
///
/// This value is used in the `metadata.type` field when initializing or
/// finalizing uploads, allowing the backend to apply media-specific processing
/// such as thumbnail generation, preview GIF creation, or audio transcription.
public enum MediaType: String, Codable, Sendable {
    /// Video media category.

    /// Includes formats such as:
    /// - `.mp4`
    /// - `.mov`

    /// - `.mkv`
    /// - `.flv`
    /// - `.wmv`
    /// - `.3gpp`

    /// - `.jpg`
    /// - `.jpeg`
    /// - `.png`
    /// - `.svg`
    ///
    /// ## Example Use Cases
    ///
    /// - Product photography
    /// - Screenshots
    /// - Logos and icons
    /// - Illustrations and diagrams

    /// - `.aac`
    /// - `.flac`

    /// This case represents media that does not fit into any of the defined
    /// categories or files whose type cannot be determined. This serves as a
    /// fallback for handling unsupported or unrecognized file formats.

    /// ## Common Scenarios
    /// - Unsupported file extensions not covered by existing media types
    /// - Files without a clear category classification
    /// - Fallback when type detection fails
    /// - Future file format support not yet implemented
    ///
    /// ## Usage Examples
    /// ```swift
    /// // When file type cannot be determined
    /// let mediaType: MediaType = .unknown
    ///
    /// // When handling unrecognized uploads
    /// if mediaType == .unknown {
    ///     log.warning("Unrecognized media type, using generic upload handler")
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Backend Handling
    /// The backend may apply generic processing for unknown media types
    /// or reject the upload depending on security policies.
    ///
    /// ## Compatibility
    /// - Used as a default value in type detection
    /// - Allows graceful degradation for unsupported formats
    /// - Consider logging when unknown types are encountered
    ///
    /// - Note: Should be used sparingly. Prefer specific categories when possible.

/// exact string expected by the API for the `fileType` parameter.
///
/// Using `FileType` ensures proper handling of different file formats and
/// automatically associates them with their high-level `MediaType` category.

    /// to a known `FileType`, this case should be used to prevent upload failures
    /// while still allowing the upload process to proceed.
    ///
    /// ## Common Scenarios
    /// - File extensions not covered by existing cases
    /// - Files without extensions
    /// - Proprietary or uncommon formats
    /// - Temporary files during processing

    /// ## Usage Examples
    /// ```swift
    /// // When extension cannot be determined
    /// let fileType: FileType = .unknown

    /// // For files without extensions
    /// let fileName = "myfile"

    /// When using `.unknown`, the upload may still proceed but with:
    /// - Generic metadata handling

    ///
    /// ## Error Handling
    /// - Should trigger logging for monitoring unsupported formats
    /// - May require user notification about potential limitations
    /// - Consider providing conversion recommendations
    ///
    /// ## Testing Considerations
    /// - Test upload flows with unknown file types
    /// - Verify backend gracefully handles unknown types
    /// - Ensure proper error messages are returned
    ///
    /// - Note: This should be used as a last resort. Aim to support common file types explicitly.
    /// - Warning: Unsupported file types may be rejected by the backend.

    ///
    /// This computed property provides the semantic grouping of a file extension
    /// into its broader media category (`video`, `image`, `audio`, `document`, or `unknown`).
    /// It allows you to reason about files at a higher level than just extensions,
    /// and ensures consistency when populating the `metadata.type` field required
    /// by the TruVideo API.
    ///
    /// ## Mapping
    /// - **Video**: `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.mkv`, `.flv`, `.wmv`, `.g3pp`, `.webm`
    /// - **Image**: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.svg`
    /// - **Audio**: `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.aac`, `.flac`
    /// - **Document**: `.pdf`
    /// - **Unknown**: `.unknown` (fallback for unrecognized types)
    ///
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// ```swift
    /// let fileType: FileType = .mp4
    /// let category = fileType.mediaType   // .video
    ///
    /// let params = InitializeParameters(
    ///     fileType: fileType.rawValue,
    ///     parts: 3,
    ///     metadata: [
    ///         "title": .string("Demo Upload"),
    ///         "type": .string(category.rawValue) // "VIDEO"
    ///     ]
    /// )
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Unknown Type Handling
    /// When the file type is `.unknown`, the media type returns `.unknown` as well,
    /// providing a consistent fallback behavior for unrecognized file types.
    ///
    /// By relying on `mediaType`, you avoid manually mapping file extensions
    /// to categories, reducing errors and improving readability.

/// A configuration object that defines camera behavior and capture settings.
///
/// This class encapsulates all the settings needed to configure the camera
/// for media capture, including lens selection, flash behavior, image format,
/// resolution options, and capture mode limits. It provides a centralized
/// way to manage camera configuration and ensures consistent behavior
/// across different capture sessions.
///
/// The configuration supports both front and back camera lenses, multiple
/// resolution options, various flash modes, and flexible media capture
/// modes. All settings have sensible defaults to simplify common use cases
/// while still allowing fine-grained customization when needed.
///
/// This class is designed to be Objective-C compatible and can be easily
/// integrated into existing iOS applications.

    ///
    /// ## Usage Examples
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // Basic configuration with defaults
    /// let config = TruvideoSdkCameraConfiguration()

    /// // Video-only mode with custom output path
    /// let config = TruvideoSdkCameraConfiguration(
    ///     mode: .videoOnly(maxDuration: 60),
    ///     outputPath: "/Documents/Videos"
    /// )
    /// ```

/// TruVideo SDK camera functionality. Each preset corresponds to a specific resolution and provides
/// direct mapping to AVFoundation's capture session presets for seamless integration with
/// `AVCaptureSession` configuration.
///
/// ## Supported Presets
///
/// The class provides three predefined video quality options:
/// - **Standard Definition** (`.sd640x480`): 640×480 resolution with 4:3 aspect ratio
/// - **High Definition** (`.hd1280x720`): 1280×720 resolution with 16:9 aspect ratio
/// - **Full High Definition** (`.hd1920x1080`): 1920×1080 resolution with 16:9 aspect ratio
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create a preset instance
/// let preset = TruvideoSdkCameraPreset.hd1920x1080
///
/// // Configure capture session
/// captureSession.sessionPreset = preset.preset
///
/// // Check available presets
/// for preset in TruvideoSdkCameraPreset.allCases {
///     print("Available: \(preset.rawValue)")
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Protocol Conformance
///
/// - `RawRepresentable`: Provides string-based raw value representation
/// - `CaseIterable`: Enables iteration over all available presets
/// - `Encodable`: Supports JSON serialization for configuration storage
/// - `Hashable`: Enables use in collections and dictionary keys
///
/// ## Objective-C Compatibility
///
/// The class is marked with `@objcMembers` for full Objective-C interoperability,
/// allowing seamless integration with existing Objective-C codebases.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// This class is thread-safe and can be used concurrently across multiple threads.
/// All properties are immutable once initialized.
///
/// - Note: The default fallback preset is `.hd1280x720` when invalid raw values are provided.
/// - Important: Always validate preset compatibility using `canSetSessionPreset(_:)` before applying to capture
/// sessions.
